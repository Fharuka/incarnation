<!--CHAPTER 5 THE RESURRECTION-->
<p>第五章　復活</p>
<!--
§ 26
FITTING indeed, then, and wholly consonant was the death on the cross for us; and we can see how reasonable it was, and why it is that the salvation of the world could be accomplished in no other way. Even on the cross He did not hide Himself from sight; rather, He made all creation witness to the presence of its Maker. Then, having once let it be seen that it was truly dead, He did not allow that temple of His body to linger long, but forthwith on the third day raised it up, impassible and incorruptible, the pledge and token of His victory.-->
<p>
第二十六節<br><br>
さて、私たちのために十字架で死なれたことは、完全に目的に合った適切なものであった。私たちはまた、十字架の死がいかに合理的であるか、世の救いが他の方法ではなくどうしてこの十字架なのかを理解できる。十字架上にあってさえ、彼はご自分を人の目から隠されなかった。むしろ、造り主がそこにおられるという事実をすべての被造物の目に焼き付けたのである。それから、その肉体がほんとうに死んだことをひとたび確認させた。とはいえ、肉体という神殿がいつまでも死んだままでいるようにはせず、すぐに三日後によみがえった。彼の勝利のしるし、証拠としての、苦しみや痛みのない、不朽のからだで。</p>

It was, of course, within His power thus to have raised His body and displayed it as alive directly after death. But. the all-wise Saviour did not do this, lest some should deny that it had really or completely died. Besides this, had the interval between His death and resurrection been but two days, the glory ' of His incorruption might not have appeared. He waited one whole day to show that His body was really dead, and then on the third day showed it incorruptible to all. The interval was no longer, lest people should have forgotten about it and grown doubtful whether it were in truth the same body. No, while the affair was still ringing in their ears and their eyes were still straining and their minds in turmoil, and while those who had put Him to death were still on the spot and themselves witnessing to the fact of it, the Son of God after three days showed His once dead body immortal and incorruptible; and it was evident to all that it was from no natural weakness that the body which the Word indwelt had died, but in order that in it by the Saviour's power death might be done away.-->
<p>もちろん、ご自分の肉体を死の直後によみがえらせ、生きている肉体を示すことは、彼の力をもってすれば簡単であった。しかし、知恵深い救い主はそうなさらなかった。彼がほんとうに間違いなく死んだことをだれにも否定させないためであった。これに加えて、死から復活まで二日間しかなかったのは、彼の不朽の栄光が現されるためであった。肉体が死んだことを明白に示すために丸一日待ち、それから三日目に、その肉体が不朽のものであることをすべての者に見せた。死から復活までの期間が三日より長くなかったのは、人々が生前の肉体のことを忘れ、復活した肉体がほんとうに同じものだろうかと疑い始めることのないためである。まだ十字架の事件が人々の耳に鳴り響いており、目が見開かれており、心が騒いでいるうちに、また、彼を死なせた者たちが現場にいて、彼ら自身がその事実を証言しているうちに、神の御子は三日目にひとたび死んだ肉体が不死で不朽のものであることを示したのだ。みことばなる方が内にとどまっておられた肉体が死んだのが、自然の弱さのせいではなく、その肉体にあって救い主の力によって死が打ち砕かれるためであったということが、すべての人に明らかにされたのである。</p>
<!--§ 27
A very strong proof of this destruction of death and its conquest by the cross is supplied by a present fact, namely this. All the disciples of Christ despise death; they take the offensive against it and, instead of fearing it, by the sign of the cross and by faith in Christ trample on it as on something dead. Before the divine sojourn of the Saviour, even the holiest of men were afraid of death, and mourned the dead as those who perish But now that the Saviour has raised His body, death is no longer terrible, but all those who believe in Christ tread it underfoot as nothing, and prefer to die rather than to deny their faith in Christ, knowing full well that when they die they do not perish, but live indeed, and become incorruptible through the resurrection. But that devil who of old wickedly exulted in death, now that the pains of death are loosed, he alone it is who remains truly dead. There is proof of this too ; for men who, before they believe in Christ, think death horrible and are afraid of it, once they are converted despise it so completely that they go eagerly to meet it, and themselves become witnesses of the Saviour's resurrection from it. Even children hasten thus to die, and not men only, but women train themselves by bodily discipline to meet it. So weak has death become that even women, who used to be taken in by it, mock at it now as a dead thing robbed of all its strength. Death has become like a tyrant who has been completely conquered' by the legitimate monarch; bound hand and foot the passers-by jeer at him, hitting him and abusing him, no longer afraid of his cruelty and rage, because of the king who has conquered him. So has death been conquered and branded for what it is by the Saviour on the cross. It is bound hand and foot, all who are in Christ trample it as they pass and as witnesses to Him deride it, scoffing and saying, " O Death, where is thy victory? 0 Grave, where is thy sting?" (1 Cor. 15. 55)-->
<p>第二十七節<br><br>
死がこのように十字架によって滅ぼされ、征服されたことを示す非常に強力な証拠は、次の事実である。すなわち、キリストの弟子たちはみな、死を蔑視した。彼らは死に立ち向かい、死を恐れることなく、十字架のしるしと、キリストにある信仰によって、動かなくなったなきがらを踏むにじるようにして、死を踏みつけたのだ。救い主が来られる前には、どんなに立派な聖徒でも死におびえ、死者に対して滅んでしまった者であるかのように悼んだ。しかし、今や救い主が肉体をよみがえらせたので、死はもう恐怖の対象ではなくなった。キリストを信じる者はみな、ちりのように死を足の下に踏みつけ、キリストへの信仰を否定するくらいなら死を選ぶのである。クリスチャンにとって死は滅びではなく、じつになお生きていて、復活を通じて不朽の者とされるということをよく知っているからである。古い邪悪な悪魔が死において勝ち誇っていたが、今や死の苦痛は過ぎ去ったので、ほんとうに死んだままでいるのが悪魔ひとりとなった。次のこともこの証明である。キリストを信じる前には、死をおぞましいものと考え、死におびえていた人々が、ひとたび回心すると、死を完全に見下し、それどころか死ぬ機会があるなら、彼ら自身が救い主の復活の証人となろうとして、熱心にそれを求めさえもするのである。子どもですら、死に向かって走り、男ばかりでなく女も、死にまみえるための肉体的な修練によって、自分たちを訓練するのだ。死はその力を失った。女さえも、以前は死にあざむかれていたが、今は死をすべての力を剥奪された遺体のようにあざけっている。死は、正統な王に完全に征服された暴君のようになった。手足は縛られ、通りかかる者にやじられ、打たれ、ののしられ、彼の残忍さや暴虐を恐れる者はだれもいない。王が征服したからである。そのように、死は、救い主が十字架上で成し遂げられた勝利によって、征服され、焼き印を押されたのだ。キリストにある者はみな、死を踏みつけながら通り過ぎる。キリストの証人は、死をあざけり、さげすみ、こう言う。「死よ。おまえの勝利はどこにあるのか。死よ。おまえのとげはどこにあるのか。」（第一コリント十五章五十五節）</p>
<!--§ 28
Is this a slender proof of the impotence of death, do you think? Or is it a slight indication of the Saviour's victory over it, when boys and young girls who are in Christ look beyond this present life and train themselves to die? Every one is by nature afraid of death and of bodily dissolution; the marvel of marvels is that he who is enfolded in the faith of the cross despises this natural fear and for the sake of the cross is no longer cowardly in face of it. The natural property of fire is to burn. Suppose, then, that there was a substance such as the Indian asbestos is said to be, which had no fear of being burnt, but rather displayed the impotence of the fire by proving itself unburnable. If anyone doubted the truth of this, all he need do would be to wrap himself up in the substance in question and then touch the fire. -->
<p>第二十八章<br><br>
このことは死が無力となった証明として不足だとお考えだろうか。あるいは、キリストにある若い男女が現今の生を軽視して、死ぬ訓練を自分たちに課しているという事実も、死に対する救い主の勝利の証左として不十分だろうか。どんな人でも生まれながらに死を恐れ、肉体の消滅に恐怖をおぼえるものである。十字架の信仰に入れられた者がこの自然の恐れをさげすみ、十字架のためなら死に直面しても臆することがなくなるというのは、驚異の中の驚異である。火の自然の性質は燃えることである。ところが、もしインドの石綿のような不燃性のものがあれば、燃やされることを恐れないどころか、火を近づけても燃え移らず、むしろ火の無力を明らかにするのである。この真理を疑う者がいるなら、その疑いを晴らすためには、自分自身をためしにその物体で覆い、火に触れるだけでよい。
<!--
Or, again, to revert to our former figure, if anyone wanted to see the tyrant bound and helpless, who used to be such a terror to others, he could do so simply by going into the country of the tyrant's conqueror. Even so, if anyone still doubts the conquest of death, after so many proofs and so many martyrdoms in Christ and such daily scorn of death by His truest servants, he certainly does well to marvel at so great a thing, but he must not be obstinate in unbelief and disregard of plain facts. No, he must be like the man who wants to prove the property of the asbestos, and like him who enters the conqueror's dominions to see the tyrant bound. He must embrace the faith of Christ, this disbeliever in the conquest of death, and come to His teaching. Then he will see how impotent death is and how completely conquered. Indeed, there have been many former unbelievers and deriders who, after they became believers, so scorned death as even themselves to become martyrs for Christ's sake.
-->
つまり、前の話題に戻ると、人々に恐れられていた暴君が今は縛られて何もできなくなっている姿を見たい人がいれば、単に、暴君を征服した王の国に行ってみればよい。それでもまだ死の征服を疑うなら、多くの証拠と、キリストにある多くの殉教者と、キリストの忠実なしもべたちが死を日常的にさげすんでいるのを見て、それらに圧倒され、驚愕するがよい。けれども、これらのシンプルな事実をかたくなに疑ったり無視したりしてはならない。そうではなく、石綿の不燃性を証明しようとする人のようにしなければならない。征服者の領地に縛られた暴君を見に行く人のようにならなければならない。死が征服されたことを疑っていたその人は、キリストの信仰に驚嘆し、キリストの教えに来るに違いない。それから、死がどれほど無力であるか、どれほど完全に征服されているかを彼は確認するだろう。じっさい、多くの先輩がたが、はじめは私たちを疑い、馬鹿にしていたけれども、信者になったあとでは、キリストのために彼ら自身が殉教者となるまでに死を軽蔑するようになったのである。</p>
§ 29

If, then, it is by the sign of the cross and by faith in Christ that death is trampled underfoot, it is clear that it is Christ Himself and none other Who is the Archvictor over death and has robbed it of its power. Death used to be strong and terrible, but now, since the sojourn of the Saviour and the death and resurrection of His body, it is despised; and obviously it is by the very Christ Who mounted on the cross that it has been destroyed and vanquished finally. When the sun rises after the night and the whole world is lit up by it, nobody doubts that it is the sun which has thus shed its light everywhere and driven away the dark. Equally clear is it, since this utter scorning and trampling down of death has ensued upon the Saviour's manifestation in the body and His death on the cross, that it is He Himself Who brought death to nought and daily raises monuments to His victory in His own disciples. How can you think otherwise, when you see men naturally weak hastening to death, unafraid at the prospect of corruption, fearless of the descent into Hades, even indeed with eager soul provoking it, not shrinking from tortures, but preferring thus to rush on death for Christ's sake, rather than to remain in this present life? If you see with your own eyes men and women and children, even, thus welcoming death for the sake of Christ's religion, how can you be so utterly silly and incredulous and maimed in your mind as not to realise that Christ, to .Whom these all bear witness, Himself gives the victory to each, making death completely powerless for those who hold His faith and bear the sign of the cross? No one in his senses doubts that a snake is dead when he sees it trampled underfoot, especially when he knows how savage it used to be; nor, if he sees boys making fun of a lion, does he doubt that the brute is either dead or completely bereft of strength. These things can be seen with our own eyes, and it is the same with. the conquest of death. Doubt no longer, then, when you see death mocked and scorned by those who believe in Christ, that by Christ death was destroyed, and the corruption that goes with it resolved and brought to end.

§ 30

What we have said is, indeed, no small proof of the destruction of death and of the fact that the cross of the Lord is the monument to His victory. But the resurrection of the body to immortality, which results' henceforward from the work of Christ, the common Saviour and true Life of all, is more effectively proved by facts than by words to those whose mental vision is sound. For, if, as we have shown, death was destroyed and everybody tramples on it because of Christ, how much more did He Himself first trample and destroy it in His own body ! Death having been slain by Him, then, what other issue could there be than the resurrection of His body and its open demonstration as the monument of His victory? How could the destruction of death have been manifested at all, had not the Lord's body been raised? But if anyone finds even this insufficient, let him find proof of what has been said in present facts. Dead men cannot take effective action; their power of influence on others lasts only till the grave. Deeds and actions that energise others belong only to the living. Well, then, look at the facts in this case. The Saviour is working mightily among men, every day He is invisibly persuading numbers of people all over the world, both within and beyond the Greek-speaking world, to accept His faith and be obedient to His teaching. Can anyone, in face of this, still doubt that He has risen and lives, or rather that He is Himself the Life? Does a dead man prick the consciences of men, so that they throw all the traditions of their fathers to the winds and bow down before the teaching of Christ? If He is no longer active in the world, as He must needs be if He is dead, how is it that He makes the living to cease from their activities, the adulterer from his adultery, the murderer from murdering, the unjust from avarice, while the profane and godless man becomes religious? If He did not rise, but is still dead, how is it that He routs and persecutes and overthrows the false gods, whom unbelievers think to be alive, and the evil spirits whom they worship? For where Christ is named, idolatry is destroyed and the fraud of evil spirits is exposed; indeed, no such spirit can endure that Name, but takes to flight on sound of it. This is the work of One Who lives, not of one dead; and, more than that, it is the work of God. It would be absurd to say that the evil spirits whom He drives out and the idols which He destroys are alive, but that He Who drives out and destroys, and Whom they themselves acknowledge to be Son of God, is dead.

§ 31

In a word, then, those who disbelieve in the resurrection have no support in facts, if their gods and evil spirits do not drive away the supposedly dead Christ. Rather, it is He Who convicts them of being dead. We are agreed that a dead person can do nothing yet the Saviour works mightily every day, drawing men to religion, persuading them to virtue, teaching them about immortality, quickening their thirst for heavenly things, revealing the knowledge of the Father, inspiring strength in face of death, manifesting Himself to each, and displacing the irreligion of idols ; while the gods and evil spirits of the unbelievers can do none of these things, but rather become dead at Christ's presence, all their ostentation barren and void. By the sign of the cross, on the contrary, all magic is stayed, all sorcery confounded, all the idols are abandoned and deserted, and all senseless pleasure ceases, as the eye of faith looks up from earth to heaven. Whom, then, are we to call dead? Shall we call Christ dead, Who effects all this? But the dead have not the faculty to effect anything. Or shall we call death dead, which effects nothing whatever, but lies as lifeless and ineffective as are the evil spirits and the idols? The Son of God, "living and effective," (Heb. 4. 12) is active every day and effects the salvation of all; but death is daily proved_ to be stripped of all its strength, and it is the idols and the evil spirits who are dead, not He. No room for doubt remains, therefore, concerning the resurrection of His body.

Indeed, it would seem that he who disbelieves this bodily rising of the Lord is ignorant of the power of the Word and Wisdom of God. If He took a body to Himself at all, and made it His own in pursuance of His purpose, as we have shown that He did, what was the Lord to do with it, and what was ultimately to become of that body upon which the Word had descended? Mortal and offered to death on behalf of all as it was, it could not but die; indeed, it was for that very purpose that the Saviour had prepared it for Himself. But on the other hand it could not remain dead, because it had become the very temple of Life. It therefore died, as mortal, but lived again because of the Life within it; and its resurrection is made known through its works.

§ 32

It is, indeed, in accordance with the nature of the invisible God that He should be thus known through His works; and those who doubt the Lord's resurrection because they do not now behold Him with their eyes, might as well deny the very laws of nature. They have ground for disbelief when works are lacking; but when the works cry out and prove the fact so clearly, why do they deliberately deny the risen life so manifestly shown? Even if their mental faculties are defective, surely their eyes can give them irrefragable proof of the power and Godhead of Christ. A blind man cannot see the sun, but he knows that it is above the earth from the warmth which it affords; similarly, let those who are still in the blindness of unbelief recognise the Godhead of Christ and the resurrection which He has brought about through His manifested power in others. Obviously He would not be expelling evil spirits and despoiling idols, if He were dead, for the evil spirits would not obey one who was dead. If, on the other hand, the very naming of Him drives them forth, He clearly is not dead; and the more so that the spirits, who perceive things unseen by men, would know if He were so and would refuse to obey Him. But, as a matter of fact, what profane persons doubt, the evil spirits know-namely that He is God; and for that reason they flee from Him and fall at His feet, crying out even as they cried when He was in the body, "We know Thee Who Thou art, the Holy One of God," and, "Ah, what have I in common with Thee, Thou Son of God? I implore Thee, torment me not." ( Luke 4. 34 & Mark 5. 7)

Both from the confession of the evil spirits and from the daily witness of His works, it is manifest, then, and let none presume to doubt it, that the Saviour has raised His own body, and that He is very Son of God, having His being from God as from a Father, Whose Word and Wisdom and Whose Power He is. He it is Who in these latter days assumed a body for the salvation of us all, and taught the world concerning the Father. He it is Who has destroyed death and freely graced us all with incorruption through the promise of the resurrection, having raised His own body as its first-fruits, and displayed it by the sign of the cross as the monument to His victory over death and its corruption.
